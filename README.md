# Deep Learning for Cancer Detection in Histopathological Images

##  Project Overview
Cancer detection through histopathological image analysis is a critical step in medical diagnosis, yet it is often time-consuming and subject to human limitations. This project leverages **Deep Learning**—specifically **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**—to automatically analyze tissue slide images and distinguish between healthy and cancerous cells with high accuracy.  

By learning from thousands of labeled tissue samples, the model can identify **minute patterns, textures, and structural abnormalities** that may be overlooked by the human eye. The system not only accelerates the diagnostic process but also provides **consistent and objective results**, thereby reducing errors and assisting medical professionals in making faster, more reliable decisions.
